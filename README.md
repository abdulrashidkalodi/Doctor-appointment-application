# Doctor Appointment Application (MERN Stack)
This is a web-based doctor appointment application built using the MERN stack. It offers three main interfaces:]



1 Admin Panel: The admin manages doctor approvals and can approve or reject doctor applications.
2 Doctor Panel: Doctors receive appointment requests from patients, and they can approve or reject the requests. Doctors can also update their profiles and manage notifications.
3 Patient/User Panel: Patients can browse a list of doctors, select a doctor, and book an appointment based on the doctorâ€™s availability. If the user is a doctor, they can apply to be a doctor, and upon admin approval, their patient panel transitions to the doctor panel.



# Key Features:
- Patient: Book appointments with doctors, view availability, and receive notifications.
- Doctor: Approve/reject appointments and update profile information.
- Admin: Approve/reject doctor applications and oversee the system.
